    <h1>Hello and welcome to my projects page!</h1>
    <h2>These are projects that I have either done in the past or are currently working on!</h2>
    <h2>Most of these projects can be found on my github, HOWEVER some projects aren't availbile due to either the JMU honor code or being proprietary</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned on the homepage, this is a WIP website that I will be continually working on to showcase and improve my front-end skills
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea for this project came up after I completed my music minor. The end goal is to have a one-time stop for all things music theory.
            I'm currently working on it in java, but will hopefully have it up on this website! (But that's in the future!)
        </p>

        <p>
            This is also a WIP project that will provide a variety of helpful features using the API of a game I play (Valorant)
            This is the project I have worked the least on, but it will be written in JavaScript and be publically available to download 
        </p>
